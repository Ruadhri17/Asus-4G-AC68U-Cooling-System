# Asus 4G-AC68U Cooling System
 
As Asus 4G Routers tends to lose connection during heavy work, I prepared my own cooling system which consists of:
- 4 x 40 mm 5V fans 
- Raspberry Pi Zero - to control temperature and turn on fans when needed
- Adafruit PiOLED Screen - to display temperature, fans state and connection status. (not yet implemented)
- BreakOut Pi Zero - to install all needed components
- 1 x diode 
- N-MOSFET IRLZ44N 

Remark: if there is no resistance on your GPIO pins or it is very low, it is advisable to install addidtional resistors
